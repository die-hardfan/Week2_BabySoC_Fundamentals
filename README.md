# Week 2 Task – BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling 
## Objective 
To build a solid understanding of SoC fundamentals and practice functional modelling of the BabySoC using simulation tools (Icarus Verilog & GTKWave). 

---

## Part 1 – Theory (Conceptual Understanding) 

1. Go through the Fundamentals of SoC Design notes: 
[Theory Reference](https://github.com/hemanthkumardm/SFAL-VSD-SoC-Journey/tree/main/11.%20Fundamentals%20of%20SoC%20Design)
2. Focus on: 
  o What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)? 
  o Components of a typical SoC (CPU, memory, peripherals, interconnect). 
  o Why BabySoC is a simplified model for learning SoC concepts. 
  o The role of functional modelling before RTL and physical design stages.
3. Deliverable: 
A 1–2 page write-up on GitHub summarizing your understanding of SoC design 
fundamentals and how BabySoC fits into this learning journey.

## Part 2 – Labs (Hands-on Functional Modelling) 

1. Follow the VSDBabySoC Project labs: 
[Lab Reference](https://github.com/hemanthkumardm/SFAL-VSD-SoC-Journey/tree/main/12.%20VSDBabySoC%20Project)
2. Install and use: 
  o Icarus Verilog (iverilog) for compiling Verilog code. 
  o GTKWave for viewing simulation waveforms. 
3. Steps:  
- Clone the BabySoC project repo.
- Compile the BabySoC Verilog modules using iverilog.
- Simulate and generate .vcd waveform files.
- Open .vcd files in GTKWave and analyze: 
  - Reset operation
  - Clocking
  - Dataflow between modules 
4. Document your observations with screenshots of waveforms. 
5. Deliverable: 
    - Simulation logs
    - GTKWave screenshots highlighting correct BabySoC behavior
    - Short explanation (per screenshot) of what the waveform represents
